Learn to build, optimize, and interpret LLMs through the eyes of Karsh — a quiet AI apprentice on a hands-on journey through deep research and engineering.


👋 Welcome to Karsh’s World of LLMs
Hey there — this is a space where practical engineering meets deep research in the world of Large Language Models (LLMs).

But you won’t be alone here.

You’ll be learning alongside Karsh, a shy but perseverant AI character — our fictional guide and metaphor for the inner researcher in all of us. In a world full of loud devs and flashy demos, Karsh quietly builds, breaks, optimizes, and rebuilds — chasing truth, not hype.

This site is for LLM enthusiasts, researchers, and builders who want to go beyond surface-level prompting and really understand the systems behind today’s most powerful models.

🛠️ What to Expect
Hands-on engineering with open-source LLMs

Optimization and deployment tricks (inference speed, memory, containerization)

Guardrailing, redteaming, and safety evaluations

Interpretable classification and explainable NLP

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and hallucination reduction

Explorations in transformer ablations and next-gen architectures (SSMs, Mamba, etc.)

All of this will be presented through technical posts, code walk-throughs, and research breakdowns — framed within Karsh’s fictional journey to make learning immersive, fun, and a bit narrative-driven.

📚 Why This Exists
Most LLM content out there is either too shallow or too academic. This space aims to strike a bridge between them — with a voice that’s technical, honest, and occasionally quirky.

If you're someone who:

Likes to build LLM apps and read SoTA papers

Believes interpretability and optimization matter

Wants to explore research topics hands-on, not just read them

Then this journey is for you.

Follow along. Learn with Karsh.
And let’s build better AI systems — one curious experiment at a time.
